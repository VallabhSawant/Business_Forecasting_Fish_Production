Business_Forecasting_Fish_Production
 
- Our goal is to predict the amount of fish in metric tons that needs to be captured to suffice the needs of population for United States.
- We plan to do a long forecast of 3 years to predict the same.
- This forecast will help understand the amount of fishing that needs to be done to suffice the need of the population. This will be very useful to the regulatory body to set a cap on the fishing to preserve the enviroment which going ahead will impact the fisheries that are into aquaculture.
- We are using various forecasting techniques such as NaÃ¯ve, Simple Moving Average, Holt-Winters, Regression, Arima, Exponential Smoothing and Random Walk Forest to achieve the goal.
- We are going to consider MAPE as a good accuracy measure since it is scale independent and can be used to compare different forecast scenarios. 
- After analysing all models and comparing the MAPE value, we figured that Arima proved to be the best model with the lowest MAPE value as 2.19.
- The point forecast identified us that 4931017 metric tons fishes need to captured every year from 2017 to 2019 to suffice the need of the population in United States.

OP :
Point Forecast - 4931017
