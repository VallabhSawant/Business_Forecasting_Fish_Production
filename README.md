Business_Forecasting_Fish_Production

- Our data includes fish capture and aquaculture production for the United States from 1960 to 2016. Considering the data, we plan to forecast the number of fishes that need to be captured and cultivated through aquaculture to suffice the needs in the United States.

- We plan to do a short forecast for the next 3 years.

- We plan to split the data into train and test data. After applying certain algorithms and comparing the error, we can measure the accuracy of the forecast.

- The data is in yearly format.
